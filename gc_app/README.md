This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## For dev:

To setup development with Next.js, run this command
```bash
npm install next react react-dom
# or
or
# or
yarn add next react react-dom
#or
pnpm add next react react-dom 
```
Now you should be able to run the above ```npm run dev``` code.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Location and geocoding
We are using a free LocationIQ account to geocode our search results atm. This means that you can put in an address and it will save that adress as coordinates.

## Booking
To use the booking features you have to use ```npm install --save react-date-range``` and then ```npm install --save react date-fns```.
